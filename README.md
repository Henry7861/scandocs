The purpose of this proposal is to develop a document scanner using OpenCV. OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library that provides various tools and algorithms for image and video processing. In the OpenCV textbook, we have learned various techniques such as image filtering, feature detection, and image segmentation, which can be integrated to develop a document scanner. The proposed project aims to implement a document scanner that can detect the document from an input image or camera and transform it into a scanned version with improved image quality.

One of the challenges in the existing Affine example code is that the user needs to manually find the corner points of the document to perform the transformation. However, in this project, we will leverage the power of OpenCV to automate the document detection and correction process. This means that the document scanner will be able to automatically locate the document in the image, correct any skew or perspective distortion, and enhance the image quality to produce a final scanned document.

To achieve this goal, we will use various image processing techniques such as edge detection, contour detection, and homography transformation. We will also explore the use of machine learning models such as object detection and recognition to improve the accuracy of the document detection process. The proposed document scanner can be used in various applications such as digitizing paper documents, archiving historical documents, and improving the readability of handwritten notes.

In summary, the proposed project aims to develop a document scanner using OpenCV, which can automatically detect and correct any distortion in the input image, and produce a high-quality scanned document.
